The ability to write a Dart app for deployment to a variety of devices is under
development in the following projects:

Flutter (née _Sky_)
: An experimental, high-performance framework for mobile apps.

Dartino (née Fletch)
: An experimental project to enable highly productive development
  for embedded devices.
